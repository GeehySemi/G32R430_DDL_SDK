&par Example Description

This example describes how to use  ADC1 to monitor the voltage of ADC3_Channel0 continuously.
When input Voltage of ADC3_Channel0(PC3) voltage is lower than 0.62v or higher than 2.27V，LED1 is on,
otherwise, LED1 is off. That is If the voltage on ADC3_Channel0(PC3) is not in the thresholds which is setted brefore,
analog watchdog interrupt will generate and light LED1.
The converted voltage is displayed on serial assistant through USART1.

&par Hardware Description

using ADC3_Channel0(PC3)

USART2_TX(PD0)
USART2_RX(PC12)

  - USART2 configured as follow:
  - BaudRate = 115200
  - Word Length = USART_WordLength_8b
  - Stop Bit = USART_StopBits_1
  - Parity = USART_Parity_No
  - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
  - Receive and transmit enabled

&par Directory contents
  - ADC12/ADC12_AnalogWindowWatchdog/Source/main.c                 Main program implementing the test
  - ADC12/ADC12_AnalogWindowWatchdog/Source/g32r4xx_int.c          Interrupt handlers

&par IDE environment

  - MDK-ARM V5.40
  - EWARM V9.60.2.5599
  - Eclipse V4.35.0 RC1 & clang V19.1.1

&par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on G32R430 TINY Devices.
  - Note: On G32R430 TINY Board, J10 selects whether PA1 connects to
    LED1 or the external header. Check the J10 jumper before use.
