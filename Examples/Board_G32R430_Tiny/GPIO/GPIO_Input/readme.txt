&par Example Description

This example initializes GPIO ports (GPIOA, GPIOB, GPIOC, and GPIOD) as input
and periodically reads their values in the main loop. These readings are then
printed over a UART interface, allowing real-time monitoring of hardware
signals. Using functions like GPIO_Init() and DDL_GPIO_ReadInputPort(),
you can easily configure and observe external I/O states for debugging and
testing purposes.

&par Hardware Description

USART2_TX(PD0)
USART2_RX(PC12)

  - USART2 configured as follow:
  - BaudRate = 115200
  - Word Length = USART_WordLength_8b
  - Stop Bit = USART_StopBits_1
  - Parity = USART_Parity_No
  - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
  - Receive and transmit enabled

&par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on G32R430 TINY Devices.
  - Note: On G32R430 TINY Board, J10 selects whether PA1/PA2/PA5 connect to
    LED1/LED2/KEY1 or the external header. Check the J10 jumper before use.
